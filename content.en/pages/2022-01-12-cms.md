To be able to make changes or add content to your website yourself, I have prepared an administration panel or content manager (CMS).

The **access data** you will have them in the **Google Drive spreadsheet** that I mention in the [delivery](/en/delivery/). If you want to use other access data, you just have to ask me for it üòâ

Access is adding `/admin/` at the end of your domain: `https://example.com/admin/`.

You can see more details of this tool in english here:

## Advanced

You can make changes directly in code if you really know what you do:

- The simple option is through the CMS ‚û°Ô∏è `General configuration ‚û°Ô∏è Custom codes`.
- The complex option is directly in the [icon-gitlab Gitlab](https://gitlab.com/) project (quite intuitive navigate and edit files; **access data** mentioned in [delivery](/en/delivery/)):
  - Cancellations ("Overrides"): All files that hang from the main directory annul those who use the `themes/sansoul` as long as they have the same structure of directories and file names.
  - General configuration: `hugo.yml`
  - Images: `assets/media/`
  - CSS: `assets/css/_custom.scss`
  - JS: `assets/js/custom.js`
  - Redirections: `assets/redirects.md`
  - Robots.txt: `assets/robots.md`
  - Other static files: `static/`
  - Contents: `content-[en|es]/`
    - Basic Pages: `pages/`
    - Landing Pages: `landings/`
    - Blog Articles: `blog/`
    - Blog Authors: `authors/`
    - Blog Categories: `categories/`
    - Blog Tags: `tags/`
