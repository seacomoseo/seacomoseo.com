The **SanSoul System**  is the result of development for months of work, with which I have managed to combine different modern technologies **JAMStack** type freemium services (free versions) little known in Spain that facilitate the great advantage of working extremely fast, which allows me to offer very good prices **WITHOUT SACRIFICING QUALITY** (design, usability and SEO).

Do you think it's very crazy? Well, keep reading about more features that this system offers and hallucin! ü§©

In this article I explain the technologies that I use and its limitations:


## Technologies

- Version Control System: [icon-git-alt Git](https://git-scm.com/) + [icon-gitlab Gitlab](https://gitlab.com/)
- Static Sites Generator (SSG): [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) ([more info](https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hugo_(software)))
- Preprocessors:
  - [icon-sass SASS](https://sass-lang.com/)
  - [icon-css3-alt PostCSS](https://postcss.org/) (with [PurgeCSS](https://purgecss.com/), [Autoprefixer](https://autoprefixer.github.io/) and [CSSnano](https://cssnano.co/))
  - [icon-node-js BabelJS](https://babeljs.io/)
- Gestor de Contenidos (CMS): [icon-netlify Netlify CMS](https://www.netlifycms.org/)

Hugo allows me to use personalized issues through git submodules to be able to have all the development of this project that I have created separate from each website and centralized in a single place, so that all the improvements and customization options that are adding can be updated to They volume and very easily on each website.

The CMS allows you to modify, directly in Gitlab through the identities manager, the Markdown, YAML, TOML and JSON that Hugo needs each website as a database, all from an easy to use administration panel for users not technicians.

## Hosting/Servidor

- [icon-gitlab Gitlab](https://gitlab.com/) To host all files.
- [icon-netlify Netlify](https://netlify.app/) for:
  - Process and deliver everything of Gitlab.
  - Receive forms.
  - Manage access to [CMS](/en/cms/).


### Limitations

- __Gitlab__:
  - __Storage:__ 5 GB
  - __Transfer:__ 10 GB/month
- __Netlify__:
  - __Broadband:__ 100 GB/month
  - __Prosecution:__ 300 minutes/month ~ 300 changes/month[^prosecution-netlify]
  - __Forms:__ 100 sends/month[^forms-netlify]

[^prosecution-netlify]: Netlify takes to process each site between 20 seconds and 1 minute after each change, which translates into a range of 300-900 changes/month

[^forms-netlify]: The default forms processes them from Netlify without having to configure anything, but is also planned the possibility of using [any external service](/en/rest/#others) (with the limitations they define) or even the [Google Formshack](/rest/#google-forms) (to have no limitation).
