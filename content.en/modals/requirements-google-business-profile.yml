title: Google Business Profile
description: |
  I strongly recommend having this service. Both for visibility (you have a physical place or not) and for the possibility of leaving you reviews (so I could copy them directly for the corresponding section).

  - **If you already have:** I can help you optimize it (or at least I can link it with your website). For it: [Google Business](https://business.google.com/) ➡️ Select your company ➡️ Look for the 3 point icon icon-ellipsis-vertical ➡️ `Business Profile Settings ➡️ Administrators ➡️ Add` ➡️ Enter the email <code>[seacomoseo@gmail.com]()</code> with access to **Owner** ➡️ `Invite`.
  - **If you don't have:** I can create the profile. Once created, around 13 days a physical postal letter must arrive at the location indicated with a code that you must facilitate to verify that the business exists right there. From there the profile will be shown in Google and Google Maps and you can indicate reviews and other information. I will give you permits to be able to manage it yourself.
