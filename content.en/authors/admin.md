Hello!

On the Internet I use the Nick **Loren San Sol**.

Obviously it is not my real name, they are abbreviations of my full name and surname.

I was born in 84, I am a native of Murcia (Spain) and I dedicate myself to **web design, development and positioning** since the beginning of 2014.

Although from my childhood I already made some pinitos stamping many applications and more advance A totally self -taught form, dedicating more and more time and desire, discovering that, despite being a technical architect, this is what cool me!

Over time I have been learning a lot and, although **I specialized in the SEO ONPage**, I have been turning for the **layout and web development**.

I am not a designer, but I have many knowledge and handle myself with everything related. I could say the same about web development and user experience (UX).

I believe that my potential is in adaptability and combining technology with creativity.

And well, outside the web world, the other things to which my time is currently Latin dances, calisthenics, travel (I consider me digital transhumant), watch videos about science and technology, socialize and personal growth. Although I have had so many hobbies and interests, how strange it would be if you and I did not match any!

See you!
